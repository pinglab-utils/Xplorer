The retention of sinus secretions is the most important event in the development of sinusitis. This creates a favorable milieu for the growth of infection agents and may be caused by the obstruction or narrowing of sinus ostia, mucociliary dysfunction and changes in mucus composition. 90% of sinus infections involve the maxillary sinus. Chronic sinusitis refers to symptom duration lasting 3 months or more. Diagnosis of sinusitis is based on past history and physical examination findings. The CT scan is the most sensitive technique in evaluating sinus disease. The goals of management of chronic sinusitis are to eradicate infection, to relieve ostiomeatal obstruction, to normalize mucociliary clearance, and to prevent complications. When pharmaceutical treatment does not have any remarkable improvement or when a surgical approach can be chosen as patient's complication, surgical intervention should be aimed to establish an effective sinus drainage from the ostium. .

This chapter is not intended for mortality reporting.

This list represents a union set of harmonized traditional medicine conditions of the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean classifications.  For an extended list of traditional medicine conditions, please refer to the International Classification of Traditional Medicine (ICTM). \n\n\n**Definitions:** \n\nA disorder in traditional medicine, disorder (TM1)[1], refers to a set of dysfunctions in any of the body systems which presents with associated manifestations, i.e. a single or a group of specified signs, symptoms, or findings. Each disorder (TM1) may be defined by its symptomatology, etiology, course and outcome, or treatment response. \n\n1. Symptomatology: signs, symptoms or unique findings by traditional medicine diagnostic methods, including inspection such as tongue examination, history taking (inquiry), listening and smelling examination, palpation such as pulse taking, abdominal examination, and other methods. \n\n2. TM Etiology: the underlying traditional medicine explanatory style, such as environmental factors (historically known in TM translations as the external contractions), emotional factors (historically known in TM translations as the seven emotions), or other pathological factors, processes, and products. \n\n3. Course and outcome: a unique path of development of the disorder (TM1) over time. 4 Treatment response: known response to traditional medicine interventions. In defining a disorder (TM1), symptomology and etiology are required. Course and outcome, and treatment response are optional. \n\nA pattern in traditional medicine, pattern (TM1), refers to the complete clinical presentation of the patient at a given moment in time including all findings. Findings may include symptomology or patient constitution, among other things. \n\n1. Symptomatology (as above). \n2.
